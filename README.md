# KnowledgeCube_Elearning_App
 
 KnowledgeCube is an online learning platform designed to empower individuals and organizations to
 create and share short courses on various subjects. The platform will be built using a modern technology
 stack to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience for both course creators and learners. Key
 components of the platform will include a course creation suite, a content delivery system, and a user
 management system.
 The front-end will be designed with a responsive and intuitive user interface, ensuring a seamless
 experience across various devices. The back-end will consist of a robust API that handles all data
 transactions and supports role-based access control to protect sensitive information. The database will
 store and manage all relevant data, including user information, course details, and learning progress.
